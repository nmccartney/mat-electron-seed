# Angular Electron Seed

This seed combines the technologies of Angular (4+) with [Electron](https://electron.atom.io/) to create a robust development stack for creating Desktop applications. Leveraging the stock AngularCLI build process, we are able to maintain webpack and stock tooling with minimal tweaking.
